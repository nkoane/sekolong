# Computer Programming

Programming is about **intent**. That all. Once you know hour intent, you work your way from where you are to that intent. You go find, find the tools needed to make it, once you have you then you can refine your intent, then rinse and repeat.

We will use, the following toolsets,

1. HTML,
2. CSS, and
3. JavaScript

to achieve, a very narrow intent, then we will refine that intent once a baseline has been achieved.

HTML and CSS are not programming languages, but computer programming, is about achieving and intent, if HTML and CSS can realise that intent, we are done. In fact, Java (the OG) would require an extensive amount of time, resources and effort just to make a hyperlink.

Now, rembember this always: intent, what is it that you want done.

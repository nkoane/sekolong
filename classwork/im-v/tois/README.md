# L:GHT HOUSE

This is a simple web project that demonstrates how to toggle between light and dark mode by clicking anywhere on the page.

## Features

- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle:** Click anywhere on the page to switch between light and dark themes.
- **Smooth Transition:** The background color transitions smoothly when toggling modes.
- **Minimal Setup:** No dependencies or frameworks required.

## Files

- [`index.html`](index.html): The main HTML file that loads the CSS and JavaScript.
- [`main.css`](main.css): Contains styles for light and dark modes, and centers the content.
- [`main.js`](main.js): Handles the click event to toggle the dark mode.

## How It Works

1. The page loads in light mode by default.
2. When you click anywhere on the page, the JavaScript toggles the `dark` class on the `<body>`.
3. The CSS changes the background and text color based on whether the `dark` class is present.

## Usage

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. Open [`index.html`](index.html) in your web browser.
3. Click anywhere on the page to toggle between light and dark mode.
